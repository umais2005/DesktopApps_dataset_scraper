Programmed to give you a responsive sound/feel, this thing will soar over the orchestra, but also fit right into whatever mix you\u2019re working on. It features 3X round robin borrowed legato, TRUE legato transitions, and a nearly 3 octave span that is incredibly consistent., and because it utilizes some of Kontakt\u2019s time machine features, it is a more taxing instrument than many of our others. But it\u2019s worth the extra resources. We know you\u2019ll find a use for Chapman trumpet in your sample arsenal. You can also download\u00a0Native Instruments \u2013 Massive X VST. Embertone is Alex Davis and Jonathan Churchill, two guys who produce Kontakt-based sampled instruments that are simple and straightforward, and also inexpensive. Since there are so many complex mega-instruments around already, it was a nice change to look at a few that took a simpler approach. Embertone also has a couple of free instruments that you can download. \u00a0The Atomraffe is a weird thing with no controls and made up of cow, dinosaur and elf sounds. I\u2019m not sure how much use it is, but it\u2019s free. A little more serious is Intimate Strings Lite, which is much more practical. There are three patches: legato, sordino and sustain and I have to say they are excellent. You may also download InstruCalc Instrument Sizing Suite.",
